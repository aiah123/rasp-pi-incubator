A program for an incubator using Raspberry Pi.
The RPi has a thermometer and an IR switch. The IR switch turns on a heating source.

The code assumes there is a working temperature sensor DS18B20.
First Use configuration:
* make the sensors modules load on restart, update /etc/modules with these commands:
w1_gpio
w1_therm

* In some RPi version, you will also have to add this line to /boot/config.txt:
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4

* After restart, you should be able to see your device id by running:
ls -d /sys/bus/w1/devices/28*

* Insert that id in the file thermometer.py, in the line 
device_id = <X>


Usage:
python -m rasp-pi-incubator.incubator --target_temp=<degrees celsius> --tolerance=<tolerance in celsius>

The tolerance indicates when the heating source should be switched on/off. It does not ensures the temperature will stay within the tolerance bounds.
However, in all experiments, the temperature did not deviate in more than 1C from the tolerance.
